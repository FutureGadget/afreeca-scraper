## Summary
ShineeScraper is an Afreeca TV live stream downloader.
Download afreeca live stream and upload it to Google drive, then send you an email so that you can watch it later anytime you want.

# How to execute this program?
1. You should configure which BJ this program should monitor. When the BJ starts streaming, the recording will be started automatically. Only 1 BJ can be monitored at a time.
2. Google API secret json file is needed and properly located.
3. Youtube and gmail token should be set.
4. Necessary directories should be made in advance.
  - token/youtube
  - secrets
  - logs
  - videos

## Build and push
> docker login
> docker build -t mojo1821/shinee-scraper:latest .
> docker push mojo1821/shinee-scraper:latest

## Now, this app is dockerizedðŸŽ‰
1. To execute, 
   * with production config,
    > docker compose --env-file .env.prod up -d
   * with development config,
    > docker compose up -d
2. To send SIGINT (stop program and send the recording to recipients)
    > docker kill --signal=SIGINT {container id}

## Useful docker compose commands
1. To rebuild after changing source codes,
    > docker compose up -d --build

## TODOs
0. Make this an web application.
   - Google drive, youtube, gmail notification must be retrieved by user interaction.
   - Should be able to retry upload manually after manually refreshing token.
1. manage replica set to enhance availability
2. enhance observability (monitoring)
